# Money Transfer API
This is a simple REST API that allows users to create and manage accounts, and transfer money between them. 
The API is built using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.0.4, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store account information and transaction history. 
It is designed to be stateless and uses JWT for authentication and authorization.

## Features
The API includes the following endpoints:

`POST /api/v1/accounts`: Creates a new account with a starting balance.

`GET /api/v1/accounts/{id}`: Retrieves the account information.

`POST /api/v1/transfers`: Transfers money from one account to another.

`POST /api/v1/auth/register`: Generates a JWT access token for a user.

`POST /api/v1/auth/authenticate`: Authenticates user and responds with a JWT access token.

The API enforces the following constraints:

- An account cannot have a negative balance.
- The transfer amount must be greater than zero.
- If the source account does not have enough funds, the transfer will fail.
- The API is designed to handle concurrent requests and avoid race conditions.

## Getting Started
To build and run the API locally, you'll need the following dependencies:

Java 17

PostgreSQL

Docker (optional)

## Database Setup

Before running the API, you'll need to create a new PostgreSQL database:

```
CREATE DATABASE bank-api;
```

## Running the API
To run the API, you can either run it directly from your IDE or build a Docker image and run it inside a container.

### Running from IDE
Clone the repository.

Open the project in your favorite IDE.

Rename `application.properties.example` to `application.properties`.

Configure the database connection in `application.properties` to match yor db and db credentials.

Run the MoneyTransferApplication class.

### Running with Docker

Clone the repository.

Build the Docker image:

```
mvn install

docker build -t money-transfer-0.0.1.jar .
```
Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 money-transfer-0.0.1.jar
```
## Authentication and Authorization

The API is stateless and uses JWT for authentication and authorization. 
To authenticate, clients must send a POST request to `/api/v1/auth/authenticate` with a valid username and password. 

```
POST /api/v1/auth/authenticate

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```
The API will respond with a JWT access token, which clients must include in the Authorization header of all subsequent requests.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

By default, the API is configured to use the HS256 algorithm to sign and verify JWT tokens.

## Health Checks and Monitoring
The API also includes Spring Boot Actuator for health checks and monitoring. The following endpoints are available:

`/actuator/health`: Returns the health status of the application.

`/actuator/info`: Returns custom application information (configured in application.properties).

By default, these endpoints are only available to authenticated clients.

## Testing
To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```mvn test```
